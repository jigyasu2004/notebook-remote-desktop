# Notebook to Remote Desktop

Deploy a complete remote desktop using Kaggle or google colab notebook using Xvfb, XFCE, noVNC, and ngrok. This project enables you to access a full-featured GUI computer remotely—including a web browser, terminal, and desktop applications—using Kaggle’s or collab network.

## Overview

This repository provides a solution to set up a remote desktop environment within a Notebook. The system leverages:
- **Xvfb**: A virtual framebuffer to create a virtual display.
- **XFCE**: A lightweight desktop environment.
- **x11vnc**: A VNC server that shares the virtual display.
- **noVNC**: A web-based VNC client to access the desktop via a browser.
- **ngrok**: A tunneling service that exposes the noVNC server to the public internet over HTTP.

With this setup, you can run a complete GUI computer on notbook, Kaggle’s servers, google colab and interact with it remotely.

## Features

- **Full Desktop Environment**: Access a complete GUI, including a taskbar, menus, and system utilities.
- **Remote Access**: Connect via noVNC using an HTTP tunnel created by ngrok.
- **Easy Setup**: Run all components from a single Notebook.
